Server Buddy restaurant ordering system

After working as a restaurant server, I came to believe that there must be a better way to
  get a table's order entered than what was being used. My final project at The Iron Yard gave me the opportunity
  to build a better system, starting with the experience of the server entering the order.
  
This was my final project at the Iron Yard. Users can sign up their restaurant, add employees and take orders, and process those orders.
